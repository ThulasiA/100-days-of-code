# Round 2 of 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26-28 Apr 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
- Re Organized my old projects
- Focused on YDKJS Scope edition
- Learned more on React Context API 

**Thoughts:** Wanted to focus more on theory aspects of JS and React. 

### Day 29 Apr 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced dynamic html for creating list elements on CSS Chessboard 

**Notes:** Came across this valuable tip: Reduce Activity in loops to improve performance. Instead of i < arr.length on for loop, assign a variable beforehand for arr.length. let l = arr.length. i < l;
